	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>
        <a href="https://europeishot.com">europeishot</a> is a simple app I started making when toiling in the Dutch heatwaves. It all started when some friends and I were comparing the temperatures in our home towns just to see how bad we're having it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since flicking through a bunch of Chrome tabs became tedious, I decided to practice my programming skills and made the first version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/dQw4w9WgXcQ">europeishot</a>. It started as a simple command line script that would display a sorted table of the top temperatures. As I progressed in my carrer as a developer, I would rewrite this project from scratch - just to see how far I've come.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a result, this is not the final version of this website, nor do I think there ever will be a final version... Not until we fix global warming.
	</p>

		I hope you're enjoying this tiny project of mine, and don't forget to wear sunscreen ;)
